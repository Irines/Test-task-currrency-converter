### Currency Converter Result:
https://codesandbox.io/s/currency-converter-iei9d7

### Requirements:
Creat-react-app - as starter template
High-level mockups for tech task
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c23I1p57iTinRdsLrWleEHYSxb43Cq95/view?usp=sharing
Result of the test task - link to  https://codesandbox.io/ (100% working application, we can click on everything, responsive layouts, no errors in the console or on the screen, where we can check code structure, structure of folders,  as example - https://codesandbox.io/s/y2lrywpk21)
Currency API https://api.privatbank.ua/p24api/pubinfo?json&exchange&coursid=5
On each 5th api request - imitate server error (create counter, store it in localStorage). After - reset value in localStortage. On error case - hide table, show error message.
Buy/Sell cells must be editable, on cell hover - edit icon appears, edit icon onClick - appears editable input with two save/cancel icons, input value validations - input value must be +- 10%  + initial currency value from api, otherwise - save icon must be disabled.
Example of editable cell mockup https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkF_n03lIO4T6WDcfRG5nUZL38b15U3o/view?usp=sharing
Create currency converter: two input fields and appropriate dropdown with currencies(USD, EUR, UAH, BTC), calculate button, currency for calculations - get actual (can be changed in the table) value from cell with currency
Example - in the mockups (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c23I1p57iTinRdsLrWleEHYSxb43Cq95/view?usp=sharing two dropdowns with currencies). Values in the input can be swapped (please see arrow, functionality the same as in google translate for example).
On page reloading - wipe out editabled data, fetch fresh currency rates from api
Cover by unit tests  - currency converter and function, that will validate input values in the editable cells.
Height of layout application - full screen height, without vertical scroll  header, footer - 100px height, all another vertical space - content.

### Technology stack:
React - required
State management - local state, context, Redux/Effector
Ui framework - feel free to choose any
Unit tests - jest, karma, mocha, react-testing-library
Nice to have:
Fancy UI (any framework - bootstrap, material ui, etc )
Error handling (imitate and catch server errors, handle min/max values in the inputs)
Good-structured code, react best practices are welcome
React hooks
Responsive layout
Add fancy styles for head, footer, table and whole layout
Typescript

### Prohibited:
Take ready-to-use npm packages or libs, that will provide functionality of currency converter or editable tables. List of available packages - react, redux, effector, typescript, any ui/css framework for styling, any test framework.
